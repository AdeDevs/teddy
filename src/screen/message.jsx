                        Happy Convocation, Teddy 🎓 <br />

                        &nbsp;First of all — BIG congratulations, Dora. First class graduate?? You really said “let me clear this thing with style.” I’m so proud of you, honestly. All those nights, all the stress, all the silent pressure, it paid off, and you deserve every single clap, picture, and “well done” coming your way today. <br />

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You’ve lived a really beautiful life; amidst all the struggles, pain, and joy, you manage to stay on top. In the short months of our relationshipe, you've been a beautiful soul, a beautiful addition, I hope the universe aligns for you. <br />

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This convocation isn’t just about a certificate; it’s proof of your discipline, your resilience, and your brilliance. First class is not beans. You earned it. I hope this next chapter gives you more ease, more joy, and more opportunities than stress. I hope life opens doors that match your effort and your heart. You deserve all the good that’s coming, and trust me, plenty good dey your front. <br />

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You’ve faced challenges, highs and lows, and through it all, you remained strong. But I want this for you: I hope the time comes when you don’t always have to be strong. I hope life allows you rest — real rest — the kind where you can breathe, laugh freely. Sitting back on a beach somewhere on a private island, sipping some fine cocktail and the sun sets in the horizon.<br />

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Teddy, you are such a special soul, warm, thoughtful, and full of light. You made me realize a truth that there are still good people out there. Your kindness, your wisdom, and your steady support don’t go unnoticed. You are a beautiful soul and I'm grateful for the gift of you.<br />

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m grateful for whatever forces brought our paths together — even if you're always reminding me i'm from Oyo, schooling in Ogbomoso and everything Oyo, abeg 😭. Somehow, life still said, “yeah, these two should know each other.” And I’m thankful for that. I can’t imagine my life without you in it, and I hope the years ahead give me more chances to show you how much you mean to me. <br />

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you step into life after school, I wish you clarity, courage, and confidence. May your dreams align with opportunities, and may your hard work continue to speak loudly for you. Go and conquer the world, First Class Babe ,gently, but firmly. <br />

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That’s enough from me sha. Enjoy your day, bask in your flowers, take all the pictures. This is your moment. I’m proud of you, always. Stay growing, in wisdom, and in grace. <br />

                        Congratulations once again, Teddy 🎉
